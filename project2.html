  <h2>Part 1: Research towards a Design Brief</h2><br>
  <h3>Gathering Information</h3>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p>The global wheelchair market is lucrative, expected to be worth in excess of 9.5 billion USD by 2024, an increase of 2.8% based on 2018 numbers.  The global market for electric wheelchairs is reported to be highly competitive, forecasted to be worth 4.48 billion by the end of 2020, with North America being the dominant region.  Research suggests that the largest group of users in this bracket are those with full control or at least satisfactory functional mobility in their hands and arms. Europe is also attractive as population age continues to increase due to increased life expectancy as post-war baby-boom generation reaches retirement age.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <img src="img/pic25.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p>I spoke with some wheelchair users on the topic of travel accessories. They commented on how the coffee cup holder has become pervasive in society, from cars to couches to bicycles, and yet there is a lack of well-designed coffee-cup holders that attach firmly to their chairs and hold the cup securely. They also mentioned how they felt vulnerable putting their bag over the back of the chair as it afforded the opportunity of being stolen. I was also fortunate to spend an hour with a friend and her father who is a wheelchair user. He requires some additional padding behind him so he can sit up straight, but this means he cannot reach behind him as easily due to the increase in distance. His words were “I would love a man-bag beside me.”</p>
    </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p>Similarly, one individual mentioned the difficulty she had when attempting to negotiate kerbs and cobbled streets while maintaining control of her daily coffee without it spilling and sometimes burning her legs. The current state of the art of existing designs exposes some of these dangers.</p>

      <p>Thus, there is scope for development of a new product that may remedy these issues, by combining both products into one design that is robust, attractive, functional and affordable. Everyone should be afforded the basic luxury to buy their own takeaway drinks from their local coffee shop and safely travel around their place of living, while enjoying their hot beverage and not worrying about the cup spilling out or their personal belongings being stolen.</p>

  <h3>User Research</h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <p>I chose two methods to conduct my user research - interviewing those who are the intended primary user group for my product type. & also using Google Forms to conduct a survey with some basic questions to attempt to understand some more about their needs, wants, goals and motivations.</p>
  </div>
</div>


    <h4>Interviews</h4>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>My first interviewee was a friend named Jo from Scotland. Jo works as a charity administrator. She is in her 40s and enjoys Ska music. Jo uses a powered wheelchair to travel around Glasgow. She commented that she found it difficult to find a cup holder that suited her needs as she was quite mobile and liked to sometimes bring her coffee with her if she didn't finish it while meeting friends for lunch. She also recounted how at times it was difficult to negotiate up and down paths, kerbs and cobbled streets without spilling her drink. Jo also felt vulnerable placing her bag over the back of her chair and risking it "being pinched". If she brings a handbag, she rests it on her stomach while moving but it sometimes falls off, especially if it doesn't have a long arm strap.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <img src="img/pic31.jpg" alt="" class='img-responsive' style="width: 100%;">
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>Secondly, I interviewed Jack, a student in the vocational educational programme with a local charity organisation. Jack also uses a power chair. He has limited vocabulary & restricted reach in his arms but was still able to have a good conversation with me. Jack carries his bag on the back of his chair and receives assistance from his tutors to remove items and put them back. Because of Jack's limited mobility I thought it might be difficult for him to reach for a static cup holder if it was positioned on the front tubing on his chair. However, his tutor mentioned that if it was on a machine-like arm that could be manipulated into an appropriate position, it may serve as motivation for Jack to reach for the item, thereby equating to a facility for positive reinforcement.</p>
  </div>

</div>

  <h4>Survey</h4>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <p>A survey was conducted using the Google Forms application. I requested responses on Twitter and via WhatsApp. Six responses were received in total. The questions asked were formed with reference to the original conversation I had with Jo. Most respondents indicated that they carry some sort of bag with them when commuting and travelling. Unfortunately, some of the questions did not receive a 100% answer rate, but some commented on feeling vulnerable with their bag on the back of the chair. Only a small percentage had a cup holder but the appetite for a possible new innovative product, comprised of both products was apparent.</p>

<h4>Summary of results</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>Wheelchair users require bags to carry their belongings with them while commuting, heading to work or shopping. Some of the people surveyed indicated their discomfort with positioning the bag on the back of their chair for fear of theft. There may be opportunities here to either create some security feature to secure the bag more firmly, a permanent satchel-type bag permanently attached to the chair.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>The cup holder does not appear to be as popular – one respondent commenting that he just positions his camelback beside him in his chair or bag. However, there may also be scope for development an extendable cup holder that extrudes from the armrest and can be manoeuvred into position – an occupational therapy aid of sorts for a sub-group of users. The fact that existing holders do not always retain control of the cup also suggests a gripping mechanism within the holder could be included. There are also legal constraints to consider, especially in Europe where several ISO standards apply.

  <h3>DETAILED DESIGN BRIEF</h3>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p>Design a travel accessory for powered wheelchair users, which includes both a travel cup holder and a storage area/bag for everyday usage items. </p>
<p>The current range of cup holders in this market is between $15 to $50. At the low end of the wheelchair bag market, costs can start at under $10  but go up to over $100  , depending on size and materials. The travel accessory is not intended to be a luxury item. It must be affordable for potential purchasers  and therefore the absolute maximum RRP would be advisable at circa $100.</p>
<p>The accessory will be aimed at users aged between 25 and 60 years old, who are active daily commuters, possibly studying in university or attending a place or work. It should be accessible by as many types of users as possible, considering possible limitations and restrictions on upper body mobility.
The cup holder must be made of a strong material. It must be manoeuvrable within a 180-degree lateral plain of motion, allowing for ease of access.</p>

<p> Strength of attachment to the chair is also of utmost importance. ISO standards relating to powered wheelchairs must be adhered to in this regard, especially relating to safety and dimensional restrictions. The storage component of the accessory needs to be easy to open and close and should be firmly attached to the cup holder component and the chair itself.</p>
<p>A modern, sleek appearance is desirable; something that doesn’t appear too clinical and less of an “addition” to the wheelchair but rather forming part of the chair itself. Additional criteria include functionality in the cup holder to limit spillage, while a waterproof material for the storage section is also a nice-to-have.</p>

  <h2>part 2: ideas and concept design</h2>
  <h3>Generate and Evaluate Product Ideas</h3>
<div class='row'>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>Ideas for this type of accessory came from a variety of sources and several different techniques were used to develop the design. As this is an accessory to be attached to an electric wheelchair, I experimented with a variety of locations on which it could be placed – the back, the sides, the armrest, the front tubing etc.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <img src="img/pic42.jpg" class-'img-responsive' style="width: 100%;" alt="Sketches depicting the accessory as a 'slip-on' accessory for the back of the wheelchair" />

  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <img src="img/pic43.jpg" class='img-responsive'  alt="Sketch of a swivel cup and on-armrest storage mechanism." />
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>The main creative techniques used included sketching. I fortunately I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the creative process, being able to use a spare electric wheelchair located in work for 30 minutes or so. I also spent some time observing users in real-life, using powered wheelchairs.
Regarding the possible shapes, sizes and functions of the accessory, I used some associative thinking techniques.  I examined how I could transfer the purpose of accordion file folders and travel jewellery boxes.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <p>Similarly, I experimented with the analogy of ‘flipping a zippo lighter lid / flipping a smartphone case to reveal the functionality of the product. The process of adopting some of experienced designer’s techniques solidified my belief that the product itself is an example of associative thinking, in that it is a combination of a cup holder and storage device in one.</p>
  </div>

  </div>
  </div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <p>I found producing an ideas shortlist to be quite challenging. Some of the designs I had spent more time on I regarded as less promising whereas others (which were only explored with basic sketches) have more potential for development into a concept design. Understandably I have come to realise that I somewhat of a divergent thinker, logical in approach and methodical in analysis.</p>

  <p>3 designs were chosen, paying heed to the criteria laid out in the original design brief:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Not intended to be a luxury item</li>
    <li>Low cost (under $100) (cost)</li>
    <li>Manufactured from existing components - potential to scale (manufacturing)</li>
    <li>Ability for cup holder to move in a lateral plain of motion (functional)</li>
    <li>Easy to use (functional)</li>
    <li>Modern/sleek design - 'forms part of the chair itself' (appearance)</li>
    <li>Does not appear to 'clinical' (appearance)</li>
    <li>Made of a sturdy material - e.g. hard plastic (structural integrity)</li>
    <li>Potential to have a long shelf life (structural integrity)</li>
    <li>Fits most electric wheelchairs (appearance & spatial constraints)</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
</div>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <p>There are many designs currently on the market in this area but non fulfil the use case I have focused on. There are cup holders and there are storage bags for wheelchairs but none that comprise both. This is the unique selling point of this design; one that will offer a relative advantage.</p>

<p>Because there are no other products that offer both functionalities, I was unable to establish a Datum, and therefore devised a three-tier scoring system based on whether each concept design fully, partially or did not satisfy the criterion.</p>

<p>Concept B scored the highest when assessed with reference to the criteria set out in the detailed design brief.

  <h3>Develop Idea Into Concept Design</h3>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <img src="img/pic24.png" class="img-responsive" alt="CAD representations of cozie baggie">
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p>Opposite are some CAD representations of my final concept design. I have dubbed it the ‘Cozie Baggie’, taking inspiration from the Scottish lady – Jo – who initially suggested such a product to me. It is a functional accessory, that clips onto the non-operational side of an electric wheelchair (i.e. the side which does not include the joystick for driving the chair).The ‘Cozie’ cup holder is attached to the front of the main body of the accessory and is affixed to an arm which can manoeuvre in a lateral plane of motion, allowing it to be positioned so the user can reach his/her drink with less effort. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p>The ‘Baggie’ is a bespoke satchel-type bag. Inside it is a long strip of hard plastic with ‘clip holes’ These attach to the hooks on the main body of the accessory, thereby allowing the ‘baggie’ to sit snugly in place without the risk of falling off.</p>

      <p>The ‘Cozie Baggie’ exhibits multifunctional benefits. Its positioning it will assist the user in feeling less vulnerable as the baggie connects to the cozie, which is itself connected to the chair. There is also potential for alternative features to be added, such as flip functionality on the main section of the accessory, perhaps a loose change holder could be incorporated for users who pay for coffee with cash and are in a rush. </p>

      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <img src="img/pic56.jpg" style="width: 75%;" class-"img-responsive" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>The potential drawbacks I have identified relate to user group and cost. Due to the initial concept of the baggie clipping to the cozie, this necessitates a bespoke bag to be created. It will not just attach to any satchel-type bag. Also, due to the positioning of the accessory on the armrest of the chair, a subset of users may be precluded from enjoying the benefits offered by the Cozie Baggie, should they possess certain mobility issues. Development to this stage of concept design has been a balance of heuristic and systematic design, with emphasis on the former. Further experimentation with a larger range of wheelchair types may provide alternatives to my concept design.</p>
